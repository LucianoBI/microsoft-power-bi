title: "Create and manage workspaces in Power BI "
excerpt: "You will learn how to share reports and datasets to your users. Although this can be a simple process, when you think about testing reports before deployment, it can get more complex. For instance, what if you are changing a report that is currently in use? Do you need to let the users test the report before you overwrite it? This module will guide you to creating a deployment strategy that makes sense for you and your organization. Further, if you have ever wondered about where data on a report originated from, then you will want to learn about data lineage in Power BI."

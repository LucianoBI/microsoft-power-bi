title: "Power BI Modeling Tip: Snapshot Table, or DAX Measures?"
excerpt: "I often get this question: “Is it better that I create this calculation as a snapshot table in Power Query (or T-SQL, or the data source), or write DAX measures for it?” If you ever had a scenario of creating a report of snapshots, you know what I mean. “Should I have a table for inventory stock on hand values for each day, or should I calculate those values on the fly?”. Answering this question is an important Power BI modeling step. In this article, I’ll answer that question."

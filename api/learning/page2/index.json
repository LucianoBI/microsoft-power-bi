You will also learn report design and report formatting. Additionally, you will learn how to use report navigation to tell a compelling, data-driven story in Power BI. Dashboards will help your users target report visuals to meet their specific needs. Paginated reports help you create pixel-perfect report artifacts like sales invoices, purchase orders, medical records, transaction statements, and much more.",

Evaluation contexts are introduced, and subsequent lessons describe how to write DAX formulas that modify filter context. Finally, you learn to write DAX expressions using time intelligence functions and iterator functions.",

If your data is coming in from more than one transactional system, before you know it, you can have dozens of tables that you have to work with. Building a great data model is about simplifying the disarray. A star schema is one way to simplify a data model, and you‚Äôll learn about the terminology and implementation of them in this module. You will also learn about why choosing the correct data granularity is important for performance and usability of your Power BI reports. Finally, you‚Äôll learn about improving performance with your Power BI data models.",
